# Tweet sentiment Classification

 Here, I explore some machine learning techniques for handling text data.

 ## Process
 1. Literature
 
 My research work at this point is in graph-based networks for fact verification rather than sentiment analysis, so I decided to look through the relevant literature and familiarize myself.

 The papers are documented in "literature". 

 2. Exploration and development of models

 Using a Jupyter Notebook to document my findings and progress, I clean and explore the dataset and implement a simple logistic regresison model using TF-IDF to encode the text, and a simple pre-trained BERT model for comparison.

 Both models have decent performance, with classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-scores of about 90%. These metrics have been chosen to give a holistic picture of classification performance. 


 ## How to

 To get this up and running easily, I recommend installing Anaconda.
